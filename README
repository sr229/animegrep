====== ANIMEGREP ======

(NOTE: This is a clone from https://git.danieljon.es/animegrep. Tree might be outdated.)

animegrep is a bash script that extracts the subtitles from an mkv video file (main use for me is anime), greps them for a specified word, parses them and extracts only that time frame from the source video file. The script outputs the clips created to out/clips.

=======================

====== USAGE =========

-f <file> / --file <file>  the file you want to extract clips from

-d <directory> / --directory  the directory you want to extract clips from (it does all the MKVs in the directory)

-w <word> / --word <word>   the phrase you are grepping for

-m / --merge    merge all files in one file.
